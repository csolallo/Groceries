### Intro 
To use the Google Keep API, we will set up a service account that can impersonate a workspace user and request an access token with the three scopes needed to use the Keep API.

Google version of the above is
```
For authorization, you can use domain-wide delegation using a service account or an OAuth client ID. Domain-wide delegation with a service account is a powerful feature where the service account can impersonate any user in the domain without manual authorization on their part
```

### Out of Scope

The following are pre​req​ui​sites and not covered here:  
* Creating a Google Workspace
* Creating a GCP project in that workspace

### Overview

Here are the quests we will undertake:  

1) [Create a service account](#step-1-create-a-service-account)

2) [Ensure the sa can impersonate workspace users](#step-2-ensure-sa-can-impersonate-users)

3) [Create a client id for the sa](#step-3-create-a-client-id-for-the-sa)

4) [Ensure we can create a key for the sa](#step-4-ensure-we-can-create-an-api-key-for-the-sa)

5) Using domain-wide delegation, [ensure the sa can request access tokens with the correct scopes](#step-5-ensure-the-sa-can-request-access-tokens-with-the-correct-scopes)
